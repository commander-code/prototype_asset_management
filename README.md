# BankAssets: Enterprise Asset Management Prototype

An asset management platform for banking institutions—built with Express, Prisma, React, and Tailwind.
Inspired by Snipe-IT, this prototype adds regulatory compliance, role-based access, and real-time tracking.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in the backend and frontend folders to set up and run the project locally.
Absolutely! Below is the **complete `README.md` file in GitHub-compatible markdown format**, ready to be **copied and pasted directly into your GitHub repository**. You can place this in the root of your project, and it will render beautifully on GitHub.

# 🏦 Banking Asset Management Platform (BAMP)

> A secure, enterprise-grade asset management platform designed specifically for financial institutions, inspired by Snipe-IT and built with modern best practices in compliance, security, and scalability.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Banking Asset Management Platform (BAMP)** is a **prototype asset tracking system** developed during my internship at [Your Bank's Name]. The goal of this project was to create a **secure, scalable, and compliant solution** for managing physical and digital assets within a **financial institution**, ensuring adherence to **KYC/AML regulations**, **real-time tracking**, and **audit readiness**.

This platform addresses key challenges faced by banks, such as:

- Lack of centralized asset tracking  
- Inefficient compliance reporting  
- Manual and error-prone audit processes  
- Difficulty integrating with legacy systems  

---

## 💡 Project Objective & Thought Process

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Financial institutions must track a wide range of assets — from hardware and software licenses to confidential documents — while complying with strict regulatory standards like **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**. Legacy systems often lack real-time visibility, audit trails, and integration capabilities, making asset management inefficient and prone to errors.

### 🧠 Solution Approach

To solve these issues, I designed a **modular, RESTful backend** using **Node.js + Express**, paired with a **React-based frontend**, and integrated it with **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage. The platform includes the following core components:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Asset Tracking** | Centralized management of all asset types |
| **Compliance Checkers** | Automated KYC/AML checks and flagging |
| **Audit Logging** | Real-time logs of all asset-related actions |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Secure access based on user roles |
| **Reporting Dashboards** | Visualize asset status, risk scores, and compliance |
| **ERP/Middleware Integration** | Sync with legacy systems via webhooks |
| **Mobile Support** | Cross-platform mobile app for field use |

## ✅ Key Features

### 🛡️ Security & Compliance

- **JWT + 2FA Authentication**: Ensures only authorized users can access sensitive data.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admins, IT, Compliance officers have different permissions.
- **KYC/AML Compliance Checkers**: Built-in logic to flag suspicious or non-compliant assets.
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **Immutable Audit Logs**: Every action taken on an asset is logged for auditing purposes.

### 📊 Reporting & Analytics

- **Real-Time Asset Dashboard**: View total assets, expiring licenses, compliance status.
- **Risk Score by Department**: Heatmap showing risk exposure per department.
- **Compliance Reports**: Exportable reports aligned with regulatory requirements.
- **Expiring Assets Alerts**: Proactive notifications before license expiration.

### 🔄 System Integration

- **Legacy ERP Integration**: Connects to existing banking systems via middleware or APIs.
- **Webhooks & Event Bus**: Enables seamless communication between BAMP and external services.
- **API-First Design**: All endpoints are documented with Swagger UI.

### 📱 Mobile App Support

- **QR/Barcode Scanning**: For quick asset identification.
- **Check-In/Check-Out Requests**: Submit and approve requests on-the-go.
- **Push Notifications**: Alerts for compliance violations and expirations.
